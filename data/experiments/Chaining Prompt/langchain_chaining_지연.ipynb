If the tone and style of the text foster a sense of warmth and familiarity, making the reader feel welcomed and engaged, then the value of the Friendliness metric should be high; otherwise, it should be low. After reading the blog post, evaluate its tone and style against typical friendly communication, and determine the value of the Friendliness metric using the following rating scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "          - One star: The tone is cold or unfriendly, not engaging the reader in any appreciable way.\n",
    "          - Two stars: The tone has minimal warmth, slightly engaging but largely formal or distant.\n",
    "          - Three stars: The tone is moderately friendly, balancing formal and informal elements to somewhat engage the reader.\n",
    "          - Four stars: The tone is very friendly, actively engaging the reader with warmth and lively expressions.\n",
    "          - Five stars: The tone is exceptionally friendly and lively, creating a strong sense of connection and engagement with the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "          This rating should always be an integer between 1 and 5. Thus, the rating produced should be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, based on your assessment of how friendly and engaging the text is towards the read.\n",

If the text is indistinguishable from human writing in terms of natural flow, vocabulary use, and contextual accuracy, then the value of the Human-likeness metric should be high; otherwise, it should be low. Given the text generated by GPT and comparing it to typical human-written text, determine the value of the Human-likeness metric using the following rating scale:\n",
