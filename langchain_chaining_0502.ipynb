Despite early morning snow removal efforts, many drivers still faced difficulties.\\n\\n### Strategies for Commuting During Inclement Weather\\n- **Check Subway Timetables Regularly**: Apps like \\'Subway Onda\\' can provide real-time updates on subway schedules and delays. This can be invaluable during unexpected weather conditions.\\n- **Consider Alternative Transportation**: On snowy days, it might be better to consider other forms of transport.
